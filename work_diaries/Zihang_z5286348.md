# Week 01
This week, we discussed various tasks and projects and decided to work on the "Task Management System Project." We also brainstormed and identified a potential novel functionality. What I recommended is an automatic email notification system, to remind task masters of upcoming deadlines.
# Week 02
We determined what languages for the project and assigned functionalities to each other to create user stories. Each of us added interfaces on Figma. What I have done is send connection requests part and user stories.
# Week 03
Complete figma digrams for authentication and connection stuff and the related storyboards. And added product objectives.
