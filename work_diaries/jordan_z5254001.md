# WEEK 01

We looked at the project templatethat the course gave us. We talked about it and decided to do the 'Task Management' project. We also picked the programming language that we are going to use for the project. During the lab session, we set up the software we're going to use to talk to each other and keep each other updated. After the Lab session, I suggest some innovation implementation ideas for our project.
